You're an abandoned kitten lost in a city trying to find a new loving home.
Find clues scattered all over the city to and try to guess which house will welcome you!
You'll have to survive avoiding kennel trucks that can catch you while you search for more clues.

This is a puzzle game with a voxel art style and a top down view developed for the 2019 edition of the
[Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/)

## How to play

### Controls

  * `W` `A` `S` `D` or arrow keys - move
  * Spacebar - Interact with a house, hide clue display
  * Mouse - Review clues
  
### Gameplay

There are a total of 5 clues (each related with a different sense) scattered in in the map.
You can review the clues you've found by clicking on the icons at the top right corner.

You will only be welcomed by one house. If you think you've found that house,
interact with it to find out if you got it right.
You only have 2 guesses. If you miss the second time, you lose the game.

As you find new clues, you will start being pursued by kennel trucks. Avoid them at all costs!
